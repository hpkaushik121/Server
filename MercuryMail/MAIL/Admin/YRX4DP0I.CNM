Good day,

This is to inform you that the diplomatic agent conveying your consignment box valued at the sum of $2.5 Million United States Dollars has mistakenly misplaced your address and he is currently stranded at the JFK International Airport at the moment, I urge you to call his phone number 315-326-1717 immediately.

I advise that you reconfirm the underlisted details below to enable him deliver the consignment box to you as scheduled and contracted:
 
Current Address: ............................................................
Phone Number: Mobile: ................ Home Land Line: .................
The Nearest Airport To Your Home: ......................................
A Copy of your valid Identification 

You may also contact the diplomat through his email address as listed:

Mr. David Gold 
Email: davidgold@mynet.com

For security reasons - I did not let the delivery agent know that your
consignment box contains the huge sum of money and in your best interest -  under no circumstances should you let him know the contents of the trunk box, as I will not be held liable if you disclose the content and he may be tempted to disappear with your funds.

The consignment was moved from here as family treasure, so never allow him to open the box until it get to your house.  


Submit the above requested details and always use the CONSIGNMENT CODE FLL/T625/017/AF as your subject when you email him, he will quickly respond to you.


Best wishes,
 
Mike Anderson
